it's not the index file (dice is thinking always runs)
it's not the embed (ran the embed with a static array and it worked perfectly)
it IS in the promise (reintroduced the promise and it broke again)
    - it's not the readstream (removed everything else)
    - it's not .pipe (isolated it)
    - it's not .on (isolated it)
    - it's not noodle = row
    - meaning it must be the conditional

It was regenerating the random number every time it compared - sometimes there would be a collision, sometimes not.
Moved the random number outside of the promise function - should stop it from running every time.
